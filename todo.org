** AltLink: Replace archive.today links with archive.org links
*** Job Request
- https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-good-website-to-hire-cheap-freelancers-for-basic-data-entry
- https://www.freelancer.com
- I am looking for a freelancer to help me fix citation entries in my
  bibliography. There is no citation style. The parts are "tagged."  I
  am flexible with the time 1 to 4 months.  There are 70 to 80
  citation links that need to be fixed. I think an average of
  5min/entry would be needed.  See attached file for directions and
  examples.

*** For Media: link, fixup the AltLink tags
  - The archive.vn links in AltLink are mostly broken. Replace them with
    web.archive.org page links.
  1. Go to https://archive.org/web/ (the Wayback Machine at Internet
    Archive)
  2. Enter the orginal Link url
  3. Find a copy at or just after the cited Date
    - if there is more than one copy for the Date, use the one with
      the latest time.
    - Or use the "Wayback Machine" Chrome extension (see below)
  4. Put the archive.org url in AltLink
  5. Create a tinyurl for the link
  6. Put the tinyurl in AltLink at the beginning
  7. If the date is "very" different, remove the archive.vn link,
    otherwise put it at the end
  8. Update the Date to match the archive.org date.

**** Using Chrome extension
  1. Add "Wayback Machine" Chrome extension
    - Wayback Machine Chrome Extension
    - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak?hl=en-US
    - https://tinyurl.com/app
  2. Enter the orginal Link url
  3. Click on the chrome extension, then click on "Save Page Now" or "Newest"
  4. Continue with steps 4 to 8.

**** Exceptions
  - If the archive.org date is close to the date "in the article,"
    then don't change the Date:
  - If the date in the article is very different from the date in the AltLink reference,
    then put the AltLink date in DateSeen:
  - If Date is missing, follow the archive.vn AltLink to get the date.
    - If the archive.vn does not work, then find the newest date in
      archive.org.  (the Wayback Machine Chrome extention can be
      used.)
  - If a Link url is not found in archive.org, then the Wayback Machine Chrome
    extention can be used to archive the page.
  - If the Link url is not found at all, then add or update the Annote: line with a
    short problem description. For example: Link not found.
  - If the archive.vn Date is very different, delete the archive.vn link
  - Problems or exceptions can be noted in the Annote: line.

**** Note:
  - All the text after a "tag" is all on one line. There are no line breaks.
  - AltLink urls are space separated.

*** For Type: book, Fixup Date, Publisher, Link
  1. Lookup the book in amazon.com. If there is an amazon.com Link, use that
  2. Select Kindle, if Media is Ebook. Or select Paperback, or Hardback
  3. Add or update Link, remove "ref=" and all after that from the URL
  4. Scroll down to find the Publisher, add to Publisher: tag, Place: tag,
     and Edition: tag. Ignore the pages
  5. Add or update the Date. Include the full date if you see that. YYYY-MM-DD
  6. If there are multiple authors, put the first author after the Author
    tag. Put the other authors after an Authors tag. Last, First,
    separated with a ';'
  7. If you see ISBN, add that tag
  8. If no ISBN, and there is an ASIN, then add ASIN
  9. Shorten amazon links, if they still work. For example:
    - Old Link: https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Cause-Cory-Doctorow-ebook/dp/B0BQGGP2XT/ref=sr_1_1?crid=33GC3LJO9WQJ&keywords=lost+cause&qid=1702359164&s=digital-text&sprefix=lost+cause%2Cdigital-text%2C245&sr=1-1
    - Short Link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQGGP2XT
