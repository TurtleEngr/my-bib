- This illustrated presentation from distinguished historian and
  political economist Gar Alperovitz is a rare and stunning
  exception. Pointing to efforts already underway in thousands of
  communities across the U.S., from co-ops and community land trusts
  to municipal, state, and federal initiatives that promote
  entrepreneurship and sustainability, Alperovitz marshals years of
  research to show how bottom-up strategies can work to check
  monopolistic corporate power, democratize wealth, and empowered
  communities. The result is a highly accessible look at the current
  economy and a common-sense roadmap for building a system more in
  sync with American values.

- So what is motivating these publishers in their desire to strike at
  the Archive, if not money? One can only guess, but a clue may lie in
  the recently updated versions of works by writers like Ian Fleming,
  Agatha Christie, Roald Dahl and P.G. Wodehouse. Unlike hard copies,
  digital versions are sold to libraries on a licence basis and must
  be regularly repurchased, allowing publishers to make revisions
  right across the board and remove earlier editions from circulation
  altogether.
- 'In electronic form they can change all books in all libraries all
  at once and irreversibly without permission,' says Kahle. 'This is
  dangerous. It is not hypothetical, it is happening.'

- <i>We are all inherently delusional.</i>
- The more intensely you believe something, the more willingly you

  effective antidote to delusion that has ever been discovered is...
- The criticism of others.
- Criticism even—especially— by your enemies.
- Oh, that’s not to say you’re doomed always to be wrong!  For one
  thing, science has provided many self-check tools that reduce rates
  and levels of delusion, applying experimental and experiential
  honesty to enhance the central catechism that made science so

- The key to knowledge is relationship — personal
  relationship. It takes time, maybe years to really know someone, their
  strengths and weaknesses, their reliability, whether or not we can
  trust their character — so that we know how to use them to help us in
  our own struggles. It's the same with books. Parroting something from
  a book is not the same as knowing the subject.
- Knowledge is about <i>trust in the journey</i> we take to learn
something. Knowledge may involve things and ideas, but its how they
interact that matters.

** Id: burgess-07
- <blockquote>trust is not the important thing but actually Mistrust
  is the thing that drives human cooperation.
  {burgess-07:1h:15m:44s}</blockquote>
- That is, we pay attention to what others are doing because we are
  interested in what they are doing (or it could affect us), but we
  may not trust what they are doing or how they are doing it.

- "When Silicon Valley tries to imagine superintelligence, what it
  comes up with is no-holds-barred capitalism."
- "...we are already surrounded by machines that demonstrate a
  complete lack of insight, we just call them
  corporations. Corporations don’t operate autonomously, of course,
  and the humans in charge of them are presumably capable of insight,
  but capitalism doesn’t reward them for using it. On the contrary,
  capitalism actively erodes this capacity in people by demanding that
  they replace their own judgment of what “good” means with “whatever
  the market decides.”
- There are industry observers talking about the need for AIs to have
  a sense of ethics, and some have proposed that we ensure that any
  superintelligent AIs we create be “friendly,” meaning that their
  goals are aligned with human goals. I find these suggestions ironic
  given that we as a society have failed to teach corporations a sense
  of ethics, that we did nothing to ensure that Facebook’s and
  Amazon’s goals were aligned with the public good.
- We need for the machines to wake up, not in the sense of computers
  becoming self-aware, but in the sense of corporations recognizing
  the consequences of their behavior.

- <blockquote>a number of transaction costs involved in using the
  market; the cost of obtaining a good or service via the market
  actually exceeds the price of the good. Other costs, including
  search and information costs, bargaining costs, keeping trade
  secrets, and policing and enforcement costs, can all potentially add
  to the cost of procuring something from another party. This suggests
  that firms will arise which can internalise the production of goods
  and services required to deliver a product, thus avoiding these
  costs.{coase-02}</blockquote>

- <blockquote>
- So what can we do about our “Ignore more, care less, everything is
  fine!” era? We need to stop enabling it. This starts by being more
  attuned to our “everyday ignoring” and “everyday bystanding”—like
  that pinch we feel when we know we should click through a concerning
  headline, but instead scroll past it.
- We need to work harder to catch ourselves in the act of staying
  silent or avoiding uncomfortable information and do more real-time
  course correcting.
- We need to guard against lowering our standards for normalcy. When
  we mentally and emotionally recalibrate to the new normal, we also
  disassociate from our own humanity.
- We need to demand that our leaders give the full truth and hold them
  to account. We must stand up for the silenced and stand with the
  silence-breakers.
- To counter the new normal’s assault on normalcy, we must double down
  on our /duty to know,/ to speak up, and to remember.

- Myth #2 - You need to change attitudes to change behavior. (No)

  + Attitudes follow behavior
    + Set behavioral expectations
    + Connect to values
- Myth #3 - People know what motivates them to take action

- In a way, they are in a cult. It's a group of people holding
  a different belief system and reinforcing it for each other.
- It's almost impossible to hold a different belief system from the
  dominant one by yourself. You naturally seek out other people who
  echo it back to you, and who can help you elaborate it and explore
  it. The formation of a new culture is a group process.  The word
  cult and the word culture are obviously related. I would say that
  the dominant culture could be called a cult. And the word cult means
  a culture that is separate from the dominant culture, therefore, it
  is called a cult. What makes a cult toxic—and the dominant culture
  is toxic—is when there's severe punishment for deviance, when you
  face ostracism and even retribution if you fail to profess the
  beliefs that the cult mandates. If you don’t exhibit the behaviors
  and abide by the taboos and rituals of the cult, you get in big
  trouble.

- The Haudenosaunee Confederacy of the Iroquois

The Haudenosaunee Confederacy was a model for the U.S. Constitution.
Chief ... was a skilled orator, who went to England. He showed how the
English system was barbaric compared to the Haudenosaunee Confederacy
resolved problems.

"Often described as the oldest, participatory democracy on Earth, the
Haudenosaunee Confederacy’s constitution is believed to be a model for
the American Constitution."-https://www.haudenosauneeconfederacy.com/who-we-are/

- <blockquote>The Clan Mothers decide who has the chops to be a
  leader. They’re the ones who recommend promising young men for
  chiefhood. The Clan Mothers have the power to remove any chief who
  behaves in a way that strikes them as unseemly.

  If I were a Clan Mother looking for kids with the makings of good
  chiefs, what would catch my eye? I’d be watching for the kids who
  break up fights. The kids who are curious and open-minded. Kids who
  can admit they made a mistake. Kids who are slow to judge and quick
  to forgive. Kids who are strong but
  kind. {etchemendy-01}</blockquote>

- In the article "300 Years Ago, There Was a Brutal Murder. We Could
  Learn From the Treaty That Followed" by Nicole Eustace {eustace-01},
  Eustance describes how restorative justice was used to resolve a
  murder that could have lead to more violence. Looking at the
  comments on the article gives some interesting insights how our
  culture, based on domination and punishment, interpretes restoritive
  justice. It sees restoritive justice as just "paying back" the
  victim, which will be unjust to the poor.

- <blockquote><p>"Read the book before passing judgement that punishment
  is needed as a deterrent. Indigenous justice was based on victim or
  survivor’s satisfaction that the remedy of the wrong had been
  righted. It could include taking a life, property or a acceptance of
  an apology. It’s designed to restore balance and not lord power of one
  over another." {eustace-01:comment: Roland Rivard, Wisconsin,
  2022-11-30}</p></blockquote>

- This gets to the core part of restorative justice: it tries to restore
  balance for all people affected by the infraction. This would include
  the victim, their family, their friends, and the family and friends of
  the perpetrator. The goal is to try for healing on all sides.

- <blockquote><p>"Two points:<br> Every society has both wisdom and
  folly. The Europeans thought they knew everything because their
  weaponry was most advanced. But there is much to be learned from all
  cultures.
  - "For perpetrators who have access to empathy, reparations and
    reconciliation work. But for those who have no empathy - serial
    rapists, serial killers, mob bosses, etc - the only answer is to
    prevent them from harming any more people."  {eustace-01:comment:
    Lauren Noll, Massachusetts, 2022-11-30}</p></blockquote>

- I agree with this last part: if all parties involved are not willing
  to follow a restorative justice process, then it would be best to
  then use the current justice process.

- Why people can't seem to get work done at work.
- When
  asked, where got when you really need to get something done? Most
  people will answer with:
  + A place, a location, or a
    room
  + A moving object (e.g. train, plane)
  + A time
- No one answers with "the office".
- The "day" is shredded in to "work moments".
- Creative people need long stretches of time to get work done. Duh,
  this has been measured by many consultants (see Tom DeMarco): it
  takes 20min to get in a productive "flow" mode. Good metaphor: would
  you say you slept well if you were woken up once an hour, through
  the night? Work is like that.
- The main problem: Meetings and Manager.
- Some things to try:
  + No talk Thursdays, or maybe just no talk Thursday afternoons.
  + Use passive communication (email, IM, etc.) - but you cannot be
    required to answer right away.
  + Just cancel meetings.

- <blockquote>
  - Interviewer: You asked me what I was so afraid of giving up [to
    help fight climate change]. I think the answer that I gave you in
    the moment was cockamamie. The real answer to why I might be
    reluctant to change behaviors actually has more to do with
    selfishness.
  - Johnson: That’s good of you to admit. I think we all want to hold
    on to our comforts.
  - Interviewer: Is there an antidote to that kind of thinking?
  - Johnson: I think the answer is community. We have to be
    responsible to more than ourselves. We have to feel an obligation
    to more than our children. It can’t just be a selfish desire to
    hold on to what we currently have. You can maybe grip tightly onto
    your comfort in the short term, but the more we resist being part
    of the collective solution, the less likely that collective
    solution is to happen. In a sense, you’re echoing a bit of this
    bunker mentality where we have these megawealthy people who are
    buying up land in New Zealand and wherever else trying to save
    themselves. That seems like such a sad way to see the world. Like,
    do you want to live in a bunker for a year eating canned rations?
    Is that the life we want to build? Or do we all try to make sure
    we have a world where there’s enough for everybody, where no one
    takes too much and we share what we have. I’d rather share.

  symptom of human arrogance. Imagine yourself with the task of
  overseeing your body's physical processes. Do you understand the way
  it works well enough to keep all its systems in operation? Can you
  make your kidneys function? Can you control the removal of waste?
  Are you conscious of the blood flow through your arteries, or the
  fact that you are losing a hundred thousand skin cells a
  minute?--Lynn Margulis{margulis-02}</blockquote>

** Id: margulis-02
- <blockquote>Life is a planetary-level phenomenon and Earth’s surface
  as been alive for at least 3,000 million years. To me, the human
  move to take responsibility for the living Earth is laughable—the
  rhetoric of the powerless. The planet takes care of us, not we of
  it. Our self-inflated moral imperative to guide a wayward Earth or
  heal our sick planet is evidence of our immense capacity for
  self-delusion. Rather, we need to protect us from
  ourselves.{margulis-02:loc1571}</blockquote>
- <blockquote>We people are just like our planetmates. We cannot put
  an end to nature; we can only pose a threat to ourselves. The notion
  that we can destroy all life, including bacteria thriving in the
  water tanks of nuclear power plants or boiling hot vents, is
  ludicrous. I hear our nonhuman brethren snickering: “Got along
  without you before I met you, gonna get along without you now,” they
  sing about us in harmony. Most of them, the microbes, the whales,
  the insects, the seed plants, and the birds, are still singing. The
  tropical forest trees are humming to themselves, waiting for us to
  finish our arrogant logging so they can get back to their business
  of growth as usual. And they will continue their cacophonies and
  harmonies long after we are gone.{margulis-02:loc1776}</blockquote>

  - "There once was a farmer who grew excellent quality corn. Every
    year he won the award for the best grown corn. One year a
    newspaper reporter interviewed him and learned something
    interesting about how he grew it. The reporter discovered that the
    farmer shared his seed corn with his neighbors. “How can you
    afford to share your best seed corn with your neighbors when they
    are entering corn in competition with yours each year?” the
    reporter asked.
  - “Why sir,” said the farmer, “Didn’t you know? The wind picks up
    pollen from the ripening corn and swirls it from field to
    field. If my neighbors grow inferior corn, cross-pollination will
    steadily degrade the quality of my corn. If I am to grow good
    corn, I must help my neighbors grow good corn.”
  - So it is with our lives. Those who want to live meaningfully,
    healthy, and well must help enrich the lives of others, for the
    value of a life is measured by the lives it touches. And those who
    choose to be happy must help others find happiness, for the
    welfare of each is bound up with the welfare of all.

- C. P. Snow, in 1961, pointed to its importance when he wrote:
- <blockquote>When you think of the long and gloomy history of man,
  you will find more hideous crimes have been committed in the name of
  obedience than have ever been committed in the name of rebellion. If
  you doubt that, read William Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third
  Reich. The German Officer Corps were brought up in the most rigorous
  code of obedience ... in the name of obedience they were party to,
  and assisted in, the most wicked large-scale actions in the history
  of the world.</blockquote>
- The Nazi extermination of European Jews is the most extreme instance
  of abhorrent immoral acts carried out by thousands of people in the
  name of obedience. Yet in lesser degree this type of thing is
  constantly recurring: ordinary citizens are ordered to destroy other
  people, and they do so because they consider it their duty to obey
  orders. Thus, obedience to authority, long praised as a virtue,
  takes on a new aspect when it serves a malevolent cause; far from
  appearing as a virtue, it is transformed into a heinous sin.

- My problem with this libertarian view (From "The ecstasy of
  influence", below at 2012-04-10): "The power of a gift economy
  remains difficult for the empiricists of our market culture to
  understand. In our times, the rhetoric of the market presumes that
  everything should be and can be appropriately bought, sold, and
  owned--a tide of alienation lapping daily at the dwindling redoubt
  of the unalienable. In free-market theory, an intervention to halt
  propertization is considered "paternalistic," because it inhibits
  the free action of the citizen, now reposited as a "potential
  entrepreneur." Of course, in the real world, we know that
  child-rearing, family life, education, socialization, sexuality,
  political life, and many other basic human activities require
  insulation from market forces. In fact, paying for many of these
  things can ruin them.

- Extra chapter added to Sicko. Comment: @TwinTn: Just to clear
  something up: Bastøy is not a normal prison sentence, it is a
  rehabilitation program at the end of a long sentence. Murderers and
  rapists are not normally sent directly to bastøy. They may serve
  several years in a closed prison, and if they behave and pose little
  threat, they may finish their sentence at Bastøy. The maximum prison
  sentence in Norway is indeed 21 years, but if an inmate poses a
  serious threat to society, he can be held indefinitely
  (eg. life). To summarize: The Norwegian prison system does not
  release inmates according to when society is ready to take them
  back, but when the inmates are ready to be a part of society again.

    the mgrs)
  + Increase the total quantity of power (empower everybody, enough
    power so they can take risks and cooperate more, because they have
    more control)
  + Extend the shadow of the future (create feedback loops to show
    consequences to actions, for example have design engineers follow
    their product through the lifecycle)
  + Increase reciprocity (remove buffers that make us self-sufficient,
    so that we will have to cooperate)
  + Reward those who cooperate (blame is not for failure, blame is for
    failing to help, or failing to ask for help)
- The real battle is not against our competitors, it is against our
  own bureaucracies.

- Wow the lack of U.S. government inaction for Covid-19 is criminal!
- Author Max Brooks became an expert on disaster preparedness - from
  pandemics to nuclear war - through researching for his books, "World
  War Z," "Germ Warfare" and the forthcoming "Devolution." He spoke
  with Terry Gross about how the federal government is designed to
  respond to crises like COVID-19 - and what is preventing the tasks
  forces from being deployed. He will also explain why "panic is not
  preparation," and how to have good "fact-hygiene."

  His suggestion is that any group tasked with redistricting needs to
  use algorithms that are reviewable by the public so that "special"
  biases can be identified. Have maybe 5 different algorithms define 5
  district maps, then have the state or federal legislators vote on
  the ones that will be used for the next 10 years, i.e. until the

- Like others, Food Not Bombs (FNB) volunteers have been bogusly
  called terrorists. Some have been arrested, tried, convicted and
  imprisoned. Internal government documents suggest high-level concern
  that they're turning Americans away from militarism, instead
  advocating social justice, including quality education, universal
  health care, and good living wage/essential benefits jobs - the
  direct opposite of current US policy under either dominant party,
  each like the other, only pretending to be different.
- As a result, FNB urges volunteers to stay focused, wary that
  infiltrators spread fear and disrupt constitutionally protected
  activities. Especially post-9/11, <i>advocating peace and social
  justice are now crimes,</i> engaged activists potentially facing
  charges of domestic terrorism and long imprisonment for supporting
  right over wrong. The reality of today's America is much different
  than its pretense, making it unsafe for anti-war, social justice
  advocates like FNB volunteers.

** Id: perel-02
- In long-term relationships, we often expect our beloved to be both
  best friend and erotic partner.
- So we come to one person, and we basically are asking them to give
  us what once an entire village used to provide. Give me belonging,
  give me identity, give me continuity, but give me transcendence and
  mystery and awe all in one. Give me comfort, give me edge. Give me
  novelty, give me familiarity. Give me predictability, give me
  surprise. And we think it's a given, and toys and lingerie are going
  to save us with that.
- So if there is a verb, for me, that comes with love, it's "to have."
  And if there is a verb that comes with desire, it is "to want." In
  love, we want to have, we want to know the beloved. We want to
  minimize the distance. We want to contract that gap. We want to
  neutralize the tensions. We want closeness. But in desire, we tend
  to not really want to go back to the places we've already
  gone. Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest. In desire, we
  want an Other, somebody on the other side that we can go visit, that
  we can go spend some time with, that we can go see what goes on in
  their red-light district. You know? In desire, we want a bridge to
  cross. Or in other words, I sometimes say, fire needs air. Desire
  needs space. And when it's said like that, it's often quite
  abstract.

- He describes some very real problems with wind and solar. So, go
  nuclear. Well, there are safer and cleaner nuclear designs. But of
  course he doesn't address those. The issue of long-term storage of
  spent fuel was not addressed. The issue of meltdowns, with "active"
  fail-safes, in the current designs were not addressed. ("Passive"
  fail-safe designs are way more reliable.)
- Also, in his descriptions of the problems with "renewable", he only
  talked about "centralize" renewables, i.e. large scale projects; he
  quickly brushed aside decentralized options as being more
  expensive. He also characterized lots of smaller renewable plants as
  being more fragile. Huh?! He truly does not understand
  <i>redundancy</i> in providing fault-tolerant systems.

  that are being developed. For example, liquid air.

  resource will be exploited unless it is managed as a commons. We see
  the same misunderstanding of the climate commons. The climate is
  clearly a global common good, a foundational good critical to our
  survival. However, the climate has become a crisis because it is
  treated as the ultimate global open-access resource: why will the UK
  reduce our emissions if China won't."

- The second potential danger is more troubling: in a world where the
  past haunts the present, young people may calcify their identities,
  perspectives, and political positions at an increasingly young age.
- In 2017, Harvard University rescinded admission offers to 10
  students after discovering that they had shared offensive memes in a
  private Facebook chat. In 2019, the university withdrew another
  offer-to Kyle Kashuv, an outspoken conservative survivor of the
  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland,
  Florida. In Kashuv's case, it wasn't a social-media post that caused
  the trouble, and it wasn't an adult who exposed him. Back in 10th
  grade, Kashuv had repeatedly used the N-word in a shared Google
  document created for a class assignment. When Harvard accepted him,
  his peers recovered the document and shared it with the media.
- There are reasons to applaud Harvard for refusing to take these
  students. Such decisions offer hope that future generations will be
  held accountable for racist, sexist, and homophobic behavior. This
  is a step in the right direction. But there is a flip side.
- When Kashuv discovered he had lost his place at Harvard, he did what
  any digital native would do-he shared his reaction online. On
  Twitter, he wrote, "Throughout its history, Harvard's faculty has
  included slave owners, segregationists, bigots and antisemites. If
  Harvard is suggesting that growth isn't possible and that our past
  defines our future, then Harvard is an inherently racist
  institution."

- The TROM documentary is trying to present, in a simplistic way, the
  world in which we, human beings, live. We try to present the world
  that was discovered so far through the lenses of science: from the
  evolution of everything (including us) to the monetary system (the
  game we currently play), to a different kind of world that we could
  build for the benefit of us all, then back to Earth.
- We are trying to present alternative solutions to current problems
  and take into account the future, which promises to be more than
  interesting. An informative documentary, perhaps shocking and
  disturbing to many, depending on how you digest the information. The
  documentary is divided into chapters and sub-chapters due to the
  documentary’s excessive length (14 hours) and all the parts are
  connected so we recommend that you see them in order.

- We live in a world where everyone is busy, everyone is consumed,
  everyone seems confused. Money, social credits, ads, data

- A one-marble world, floating in a giant soup of stars and planets,
  clustered in donut-shaped galaxies.
- What are these humans living for?
- In a 5 hour, 4 parts documentary, we try to explore their world, to
  understand what makes them human, what makes them enslave their
  kind, destroy their habitat, and be unaware of their place in this
  universe. But also what makes them so special.
- Through the lives of 5 humans, we look at the culture that creates
  them, their struggles growing up on this planet, and where they are
  headed toward.

- The first light bulbs had a life of 2,500 hours, the consortium of
  manufacturers fined members who did went over the mandated 1,000
  ours for household bulbs. Inventors have created bulb with lives of
  over 100,000 hours. Inkjet printers stop working when they reach a
  limit on their cleaning cycle, because the absorbing sponge could
  not take any more. Buy a new printer is the only option. The first
  nylon stockings were very robust, but they had to be redesign to be
  more fragile. Designers are taught how to understand and meet the
  business goals of a product's "life cycle".
- Personally I see it all the time in software creation. Making and
  using robust software libraries and languages is not supported--the
  assertion is that defect free software is impossible. Well too
  expensive, for the expected life of the software product, is the
  real reason when engineer's press the issue. Defective software is
  good, because you can sell fixes, if new features can't be
  convincing enough.
- A bit at the end: getting off the "growth cycle". There can be jobs
  in repair and in closing the loop to eliminate waste.

  entire political spectrum, which makes me think there is some good
  philosophy to be had. So today we will look at Byung-Chul Han's
  <i>The Disappearance of Ritual,</i> where he charts the slow decline
  of rituals in our societies, and the disastrous impact this has on
  our feeling of meaning in our lives.

- Why do we all hate work so much? And why does it seem to have only
  got worse in the modern era? Well, according to philosopher
  Byung-Chul Han, our psychological attitude towards work and
  productivity has fundamentally shifted in a disastrous direction for
  our mental health, our happiness, and our long-term fulfilment.

- Longer life:
- To counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses
  against aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein,
  engage in intense exercise, experience uncomfortable cold [or
  hot]. When the body senses existential threats it triggers longevity
  genes, which attempt to maintain the body to ensure its survival
  until good times return.
- Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without
  the discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins
  to monitor and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging.

- MC is composed of many co-operative enterprises grouped into
  four areas: industry, finance, retail and knowledge. In each
  enterprise, the co-op members (averaging 80-85% of all workers per
  enterprise) collectively own and direct the enterprise. Through an
  annual general assembly the workers choose and employ a managing
  director and retain the power to make all the basic decisions of the
  enterprise (what, how and where to produce and what to do with the
  profits).
- As each enterprise is a constituent of the MC as a whole, its
  members must confer and decide with all other enterprise members what
  general rules will govern MC and all its constituent enterprises. In
  short, MC worker-members collectively choose, hire and fire the
  directors, whereas in capitalist enterprises the reverse
  occurs.

- WildX Speaker Filmmaker and Hypnotist Albert Nerenberg suggests
  there's something about sexuality the general public doesn't
  know. And it's potentially amazing. In this entertaining
  breakthrough talk Nerenberg explains he and Montreal hypnotist
  Dominique LaRoche stumbled on a largely unknown side of human trance
  behavior that opens up possibilities for sexual expression and
  healing. Humans can have orgasms without contact and with their
  clothes on. And they can do it by simply achieving a specific deeply
  relaxed state. Nerenberg claims this may open up possibilities for
  sexual healing but there is a need for an ethical framework. Either
  way, the implications are considerable and new.

- Problem: reinforced concrete only lasts 50 years. (100 years max)
- Solution: use an older process that emits less CO2, for making
  concrete, and don't use steel in concrete. Only build with
  compressive forces.
- My comment: This is a great analysis with solutions. However, to
  implement the solutions, the capitalist profit system will need to
  be overhauled to support 1,000-year developments. In the current
  system, cheaper and faster always wins over quality and longevity.
