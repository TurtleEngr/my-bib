my-bib Files
============

-   My personal bibliography. See
    [libre-bib](https://github.com/TurtleEngr/libre-bib) for how this is
    used.

-   *biblio.txt* - references to: books, articles, websites, videos,
    DVDs, etc.

-   *biblio-note.html* - Annotations related to Ids in biblio.txt

-   [libre-bib](https://github.com/TurtleEngr/libre-bib) - this tool
    imports the biblio.txt into a DB. The DB is then used by libre-bib
    and a Libreoffice document to generate the document≈õ Bibliography.
