# my-bibb
My personal bibliography. See libre-bib for how this is used.

-   [biblio.txt](biblio.txt) - references to: books, articles, websites,
    videos, DVDs, etc.
-   [biblio-note.txt](biblio-note.txt) - Annotations related to Ids in
    biblio.txt
-   [libre-bib](https://github.com/TurtleEngr/libre-bib) - this tool
    imports the biblio.txt into a DB. The DB is then used by libre-bib
    and a Libreoffice document to generate the document\'s Bibliography.
