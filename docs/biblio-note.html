  <p>Russell L. Ackoff. In the Circular Organization, a democratic hierarchy,

  <p>Quote from Amazon page.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Over the last three decades the average life expectancy of a
    corporation in North America has dipped well below 20 years. In fact, by
    1983 a full third of the 1970 Fortune 500 companies had been acquired,
    merged, or broken apart. In this landmark book, one of the business
    world's foremost pioneers, Russell L. Ackoff, delivers this indispensable
    guide for those hoping to beat these odds--and to better navigate the
    corporate challenges of the next millennium.</p>
    <p>While most business and management schools continue to teach the
    functions of a corporation separately--production, marketing, finance,
    personnel--the reality is that for a corporation to endure each division
    must work with the others to create an effective system. Re-Creating the
    Corporation is Ackoff's masterful blueprint for understanding and
    creating these model corporate systems. In four comprehensive
    sections--Background, Process, Designs, and Change--Ackoff lays out in
    clear concise prose the five organizational goals of successful corporate
    systems: plan effectively, learn and adapt rapidly, democratize,
    introduce internal market economies, and employ a flexible structure that
    will minimize the need for future restructuring. And through a deft mix
    of practical and theoretical examples drawn from a wide range of
    applications in a wide range of firms, this book ultimately guides
    executives to the system best suited to meet their organizational
    goals.</p>
    <p>Re-Creating the Corporation, which is the culmination of a lifetime of
    innovative and insightful business thought from one of the business
    world's premier thinkers, is essential reading for those attempting to
    navigate the rapidly changing economic environment of the next
    millennium.</p>

  <p>This illustrated presentation from distinguished historian and political
  economist Gar Alperovitz is a rare and stunning exception. Pointing to
  efforts already underway in thousands of communities across the U.S., from
  co-ops and community land trusts to municipal, state, and federal
  initiatives that promote entrepreneurship and sustainability, Alperovitz
  marshals years of research to show how bottom-up strategies can work to
  check monopolistic corporate power, democratize wealth, and empowered
  communities. The result is a highly accessible look at the current economy
  and a common-sense roadmap for building a system more in sync with American
  values.</p>

  <p>So what is motivating these publishers in their desire to strike at the
  Archive, if not money? One can only guess, but a clue may lie in the
  recently updated versions of works by writers like Ian Fleming, Agatha
  Christie, Roald Dahl and P.G. Wodehouse. Unlike hard copies, digital
  versions are sold to libraries on a licence basis and must be regularly
  repurchased, allowing publishers to make revisions right across the board
  and remove earlier editions from circulation altogether.</p>
  <p>'In electronic form they can change all books in all libraries all at
  once and irreversibly without permission,' says Kahle. 'This is dangerous.

    <p>we are seeing the broad and deep emergence of a new, third mode of
    production in the digitally networked environment. I call this mode
    “commons-based peer production,” to distinguish it from the property- and
    contract-based modes of firms and markets. Its central characteristic is
    that groups of individuals successfully collaborate on large- scale

  <p>The key to knowledge is relationship — personal relationship. It takes
  time, maybe years to really know someone, their strengths and weaknesses,
  their reliability, whether or not we can trust their character — so that we
  know how to use them to help us in our own struggles. It's the same with
  books. Parroting something from a book is not the same as knowing the
  subject.</p>
  <p>Knowledge is about <i>trust in the journey</i> we take to learn
  something. Knowledge may involve things and ideas, but its how they
  interact that matters.</p>

  <p>That is, we pay attention to what others are doing because we are
  interested in what they are doing (or it could affect us), but we may not
  trust what they are doing or how they are doing it.</p>

  <p>"When Silicon Valley tries to imagine superintelligence, what it comes
  up with is no-holds-barred capitalism."</p>
  <p>"...we are already surrounded by machines that demonstrate a complete
  lack of insight, we just call them corporations. Corporations don’t operate
  autonomously, of course, and the humans in charge of them are presumably
  capable of insight, but capitalism doesn’t reward them for using it. On the
  contrary, capitalism actively erodes this capacity in people by demanding
  that they replace their own judgment of what “good” means with “whatever
  the market decides.”</p>
  <p>There are industry observers talking about the need for AIs to have a
  sense of ethics, and some have proposed that we ensure that any
  superintelligent AIs we create be “friendly,” meaning that their goals are
  aligned with human goals. I find these suggestions ironic given that we as
  a society have failed to teach corporations a sense of ethics, that we did
  nothing to ensure that Facebook’s and Amazon’s goals were aligned with the
  public good.</p>
  <p>We need for the machines to wake up, not in the sense of computers
  becoming self-aware, but in the sense of corporations recognizing the
  consequences of their behavior.</p>

    <p>a number of transaction costs involved in using the market; the cost
    of obtaining a good or service via the market actually exceeds the price
    of the good. Other costs, including search and information costs,
    bargaining costs, keeping trade secrets, and policing and enforcement
    costs, can all potentially add to the cost of procuring something from
    another party. This suggests that firms will arise which can internalise
    the production of goods and services required to deliver a product, thus
    avoiding these costs.<cite>{coase-02}</cite></p>

  <p>In a way, they are in a cult. It's a group of people holding a different
  belief system and reinforcing it for each other.</p>
  <p>It's almost impossible to hold a different belief system from the
  dominant one by yourself. You naturally seek out other people who echo it
  back to you, and who can help you elaborate it and explore it. The
  formation of a new culture is a group process. The word cult and the word
  culture are obviously related. I would say that the dominant culture could
  be called a cult. And the word cult means a culture that is separate from
  the dominant culture, therefore, it is called a cult. What makes a cult
  toxic—and the dominant culture is toxic—is when there's severe punishment
  for deviance, when you face ostracism and even retribution if you fail to
  profess the beliefs that the cult mandates. If you don’t exhibit the
  behaviors and abide by the taboos and rituals of the cult, you get in big
  trouble.</p>

  <p>In the article "300 Years Ago, There Was a Brutal Murder. We Could Learn
  From the Treaty That Followed" by Nicole Eustace <cite>{eustace-01}</cite>,
  Eustance describes how restorative justice was used to resolve a murder
  that could have lead to more violence. Looking at the comments on the
  article gives some interesting insights how our culture, based on
  domination and punishment, interpretes restoritive justice. It sees
  restoritive justice as just "paying back" the victim, which will be unjust
  to the poor.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Read the book before passing judgement that punishment is needed as a
    deterrent. Indigenous justice was based on victim or survivor’s
    satisfaction that the remedy of the wrong had been righted. It could
    include taking a life, property or a acceptance of an apology. It’s
    designed to restore balance and not lord power of one over another."
    <cite>{eustace-01:comment: Roland Rivard, Wisconsin,
    2022-11-30}</cite></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This gets to the core part of restorative justice: it tries to restore
  balance for all people affected by the infraction. This would include the
  victim, their family, their friends, and the family and friends of the
  perpetrator. The goal is to try for healing on all sides.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"Two points:
    <br />
    Every society has both wisdom and folly. The Europeans thought they knew
    everything because their weaponry was most advanced. But there is much to
    be learned from all cultures.</p>
    <p>"For perpetrators who have access to empathy, reparations and
    reconciliation work. But for those who have no empathy - serial rapists,
    serial killers, mob bosses, etc - the only answer is to prevent them from
    harming any more people." <cite>{eustace-01:comment: Lauren Noll,
    Massachusetts, 2022-11-30}</cite></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I agree with this last part: if all parties involved are not willing to
  follow a restorative justice process, then it would be best to then use the
  current justice process.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We have no Government armed with Power capable of contending with
    human Passions unbridled by morality and Religion," John Adams wrote in
    his 1798 "Letter to the Massachusetts Militia," "Avarice, Ambition,
    Revenge or Galantry, would break the strongest Cords of our Constitution
    as a Whale goes through a Net.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>He cited the book "The Pursuit of Happiness" by Jeffrey Rosen.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The book describes how the founders envisioned the pursuit of
    happiness not as the pursuit of pleasure or wealth, but rather as "the
    pursuit of virtue — as being good, rather than feeling good." Benjamin
    Franklin, for example, listed temperance, silence, order, resolution,
    frugality, industry, sincerity, justice, moderation, cleanliness,
    tranquillity, chastity and humility as indispensable elements of
    virtue.</p>
    <p>Demonstrate these virtues, and your enemies can live with dignity and
    freedom even when they lose a political battle. When your enemies show
    the same virtues, you can still enjoy a good life even when you lose.
    That’s the social compact of pluralism. In a decent society, no defeat is
    ultimate defeat, and no victory is ultimate victory. And in all
    circumstances, your fundamental human rights must be preserved.</p>
    <p>Dive too deeply into the friend-enemy distinction, by contrast, and it
    can become immoral to treat your enemies with kindness if kindness
    weakens the community in its struggle against a mortal foe. In the world
    of the friend-enemy distinction, your ultimate virtue is found in your
    willingness to fight. Your ultimate vice is betraying your side by
    refusing the call to political war.</p>
    <p>The friend-enemy distinction explains why so many Republicans are
    particularly furious at anti-Trump dissenters — especially when those
    dissenters hold conservative values. In the friend-enemy distinction,
    ideology is secondary to loyalty.</p>

  <p>Why people can't seem to get work done at work.</p>
  <p>When asked, where got when you really need to get something done? Most
  people will answer with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A place, a location, or a room</li>
    <li>A moving object (e.g. train, plane)</li>
    <li>A time</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No one answers with "the office".</p>
  <p>The "day" is shredded in to "work moments".</p>
  <p>Creative people need long stretches of time to get work done. Duh, this
  has been measured by many consultants (see Tom DeMarco): it takes 20min to
  get in a productive "flow" mode. Good metaphor: would you say you slept
  well if you were woken up once an hour, through the night? Work is like
  that.</p>
  <p>The main problem: Meetings and Manager.</p>
  <p>Some things to try:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No talk Thursdays, or maybe just no talk Thursday afternoons.</li>
    <li>Use passive communication (email, IM, etc.) - but you cannot be
    required to answer right away.</li>
    <li>Just cancel meetings.</li>

  of which may have been due to the fact that the results had uncomfortable
  implications. However, it is arguable that Milgram did break several of the
  British Psychological Society's ethical stated principles:" Consent,
  Deception, Freedom to withdraw, Protection. "...it is doubtful whether
  those experiments would be allowed to take place now."</p>

    <p>After his California home burned in a wildfire, acclaimed author and
    travel writer Pico Iyer retreated to a remote monastery in Big Sur.
    There, he discovered the power of solitude and stillness to help process
    loss and cope with uncertainty. In his new book, "Aflame," Iyer writes
    about his frequent visits to the monastery over the following three
    decades, always finding joy and renewal in the "silence and emptiness and
    light"... and lack of screens. We’ll talk with Iyer about the book, and
    why his inner journeys mean more to him than his far-flung trips across
    the globe.<cite>{iyer-01}</cite></p>

    <p>Interviewer: You asked me what I was so afraid of giving up [to help
    fight climate change]. I think the answer that I gave you in the moment
    was cockamamie. The real answer to why I might be reluctant to change
    behaviors actually has more to do with selfishness.</p>
    <p>Johnson: That’s good of you to admit. I think we all want to hold on
    to our comforts.</p>
    <p>Interviewer: Is there an antidote to that kind of thinking?</p>
    <p>Johnson: I think the answer is community. We have to be responsible to
    more than ourselves. We have to feel an obligation to more than our
    children. It can’t just be a selfish desire to hold on to what we
    currently have. You can maybe grip tightly onto your comfort in the short
    term, but the more we resist being part of the collective solution, the
    less likely that collective solution is to happen. In a sense, you’re
    echoing a bit of this bunker mentality where we have these megawealthy
    people who are buying up land in New Zealand and wherever else trying to
    save themselves. That seems like such a sad way to see the world. Like,
    do you want to live in a bunker for a year eating canned rations? Is that
    the life we want to build? Or do we all try to make sure we have a world
    where there’s enough for everybody, where no one takes too much and we
    share what we have. I’d rather share.</p>

    keep all its systems in operation? Can you make your kidneys function?

    responsibility for the living Earth is laughable—the rhetoric of the
    powerless. The planet takes care of us, not we of it. Our self-inflated
    moral imperative to guide a wayward Earth or heal our sick planet is
    evidence of our immense capacity for self-delusion. Rather, we need to

    gonna get along without you now,” they sing about us in harmony. Most of
    them, the microbes, the whales, the insects, the seed plants, and the
    birds, are still singing. The tropical forest trees are humming to
    themselves, waiting for us to finish our arrogant logging so they can get

    <p>"There once was a farmer who grew excellent quality corn. Every year
    he won the award for the best grown corn. One year a newspaper reporter
    interviewed him and learned something interesting about how he grew it.
    The reporter discovered that the farmer shared his seed corn with his
    neighbors. “How can you afford to share your best seed corn with your
    neighbors when they are entering corn in competition with yours each
    year?” the reporter asked.</p>
    <p>“Why sir,” said the farmer, “Didn’t you know? The wind picks up pollen
    from the ripening corn and swirls it from field to field. If my neighbors
    grow inferior corn, cross-pollination will steadily degrade the quality
    of my corn. If I am to grow good corn, I must help my neighbors grow good
    corn.”</p>
    <p>So it is with our lives. Those who want to live meaningfully, healthy,

  <blockquote>
    <p>When you think of the long and gloomy history of man, you will find
    more hideous crimes have been committed in the name of obedience than
    have ever been committed in the name of rebellion. If you doubt that,
    read William Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. The German
    Officer Corps were brought up in the most rigorous code of obedience ...
    in the name of obedience they were party to, and assisted in, the most
    wicked large-scale actions in the history of the world.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Nazi extermination of European Jews is the most extreme instance of
  abhorrent immoral acts carried out by thousands of people in the name of
  obedience. Yet in lesser degree this type of thing is constantly recurring:
  ordinary citizens are ordered to destroy other people, and they do so
  because they consider it their duty to obey orders. Thus, obedience to
  authority, long praised as a virtue, takes on a new aspect when it serves a
  malevolent cause; far from appearing as a virtue, it is transformed into a

  <p>My problem with this libertarian view (From "The ecstasy of influence",
  below at 2012-04-10): "The power of a gift economy remains difficult for
  the empiricists of our market culture to understand. In our times, the
  rhetoric of the market presumes that everything should be and can be
  appropriately bought, sold, and owned--a tide of alienation lapping daily
  at the dwindling redoubt of the unalienable. In free-market theory, an
  intervention to halt propertization is considered "paternalistic," because
  it inhibits the free action of the citizen, now reposited as a "potential
  entrepreneur." Of course, in the real world, we know that child-rearing,
  family life, education, socialization, sexuality, political life, and many
  other basic human activities require insulation from market forces. In
  fact, paying for many of these things can ruin them.</p>

  <p>Extra chapter added to Sicko. Comment: <span class=
  "citation">@TwinTn</span>: Just to clear something up: Bastøy is not a
  normal prison sentence, it is a rehabilitation program at the end of a long
  sentence. Murderers and rapists are not normally sent directly to bastøy.
  They may serve several years in a closed prison, and if they behave and
  pose little threat, they may finish their sentence at Bastøy. The maximum
  prison sentence in Norway is indeed 21 years, but if an inmate poses a
  serious threat to society, he can be held indefinitely (eg. life). To
  summarize: The Norwegian prison system does not release inmates according
  to when society is ready to take them back, but when the inmates are ready
  to be a part of society again.</p>

  <p>Complexity makes jobs very stressful and unproductive for everyone.</p>
  <p>Simple rules for Smart Simplicity</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand what your people do (what is their real work?)</li>
    <li>Reinforce integrators (give middle mgrs the power to make others
    cooperate, remove layers, less rules, more discretionary power to the
    mgrs)</li>
    <li>Increase the total quantity of power (empower everybody, enough power
    so they can take risks and cooperate more, because they have more
    control)</li>
    <li>Extend the shadow of the future (create feedback loops to show
    consequences to actions, for example have design engineers follow their
    product through the lifecycle)</li>
    <li>Increase reciprocity (remove buffers that make us self-sufficient, so
    that we will have to cooperate)</li>
    <li>Reward those who cooperate (blame is not for failure, blame is for
    failing to help, or failing to ask for help)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The real battle is not against our competitors, it is against our own
  bureaucracies.</p>

  <p>Like others, Food Not Bombs (FNB) volunteers have been bogusly called
  terrorists. Some have been arrested, tried, convicted and imprisoned.
  Internal government documents suggest high-level concern that they're
  turning Americans away from militarism, instead advocating social justice,
  including quality education, universal health care, and good living
  wage/essential benefits jobs - the direct opposite of current US policy
  under either dominant party, each like the other, only pretending to be
  different.</p>
  <p>As a result, FNB urges volunteers to stay focused, wary that
  infiltrators spread fear and disrupt constitutionally protected activities.
  Especially post-9/11, <i>advocating peace and social justice are now
  crimes,</i> engaged activists potentially facing charges of domestic
  terrorism and long imprisonment for supporting right over wrong. The
  reality of today's America is much different than its pretense, making it
  unsafe for anti-war, social justice advocates like FNB volunteers.</p>

  <p>In long-term relationships, we often expect our beloved to be both best
  friend and erotic partner.</p>
  <p>So we come to one person, and we basically are asking them to give us
  what once an entire village used to provide. Give me belonging, give me
  identity, give me continuity, but give me transcendence and mystery and awe
  all in one. Give me comfort, give me edge. Give me novelty, give me
  familiarity. Give me predictability, give me surprise. And we think it's a
  given, and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that.</p>
  <p>So if there is a verb, for me, that comes with love, it's "to have." And
  if there is a verb that comes with desire, it is "to want." In love, we
  want to have, we want to know the beloved. We want to minimize the
  distance. We want to contract that gap. We want to neutralize the tensions.
  We want closeness. But in desire, we tend to not really want to go back to
  the places we've already gone. Forgone conclusion does not keep our
  interest. In desire, we want an Other, somebody on the other side that we
  can go visit, that we can go spend some time with, that we can go see what
  goes on in their red-light district. You know? In desire, we want a bridge
  to cross. Or in other words, I sometimes say, fire needs air. Desire needs
  space. And when it's said like that, it's often quite abstract.</p>

    <p>[the] fluid-filled spaces had been missed for decades because they
    don’t show up on the standard microscopic slides [because the] fixing
    process drains away fluid and causes the newfound fluid-filled spaces to
    collapse.</p>
    <p>the researchers discovered these fluid-filled spaces by using a new
    imaging technique that allows them to examine living tissues on a
    microscopic level.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The new process freezes the samples before the slicing process. Also the
  fluid-filled spaces collapse soon after deaths, so they won't be seen with

  <p>US incarceration rate from 1925 to 1975 was quite "stable", 100 per
  100,000. After 1975 it rapidly climbs to 700 per 100,000 (over the last 40
  years). The U.S. is 7 to 10 times higher than in European countries.</p>
  <p>Crime moves in sync with, better policing, better social conditions, not
  incarceration.</p>

  <p>This is really important! A 30 year success story--this is not just a
  vision of what could be: it is a reality. Democratic companies: take
  vacation when you want, set your own salary, interviewed and hired by
  peers, leaders evaluated by subordinates every 6 months, etc. Education
  that is inline with what John Gatto talks about: no grades, no age
  grouping, flexible hours, no breaking up the day with multiple subjects,

  <p>He describes some very real problems with wind and solar. So, go
  nuclear. Well, there are safer and cleaner nuclear designs. But of course
  he doesn't address those. The issue of long-term storage of spent fuel was
  not addressed. The issue of meltdowns, with "active" fail-safes, in the
  current designs were not addressed. ("Passive" fail-safe designs are way
  more reliable.)</p>
  <p>Also, in his descriptions of the problems with "renewable", he only
  talked about "centralize" renewables, i.e. large scale projects; he quickly
  brushed aside decentralized options as being more expensive. He also
  characterized lots of smaller renewable plants as being more fragile. Huh?!
  He truly does not understand <i>redundancy</i> in providing fault-tolerant
  systems.</p>
  <p>Others pointed out, he didn't really address other storage options that
  are being developed. For example, liquid air.</p>

  <p>"As Elinor Ostrom proved, the tragedy of the commons isn't that a
  commons is always exploited, but quite the opposite: an open-access
  resource will be exploited unless it is managed as a commons. We see the
  same misunderstanding of the climate commons. The climate is clearly a
  global common good, a foundational good critical to our survival. However,
  the climate has become a crisis because it is treated as the ultimate
  global open-access resource: why will the UK reduce our emissions if China
  won't."</p>

  <p>The second potential danger is more troubling: in a world where the past
  haunts the present, young people may calcify their identities,
  perspectives, and political positions at an increasingly young age.</p>
  <p>In 2017, Harvard University rescinded admission offers to 10 students
  after discovering that they had shared offensive memes in a private
  Facebook chat. In 2019, the university withdrew another offer-to Kyle
  Kashuv, an outspoken conservative survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas
  High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. In Kashuv's case, it wasn't a
  social-media post that caused the trouble, and it wasn't an adult who
  exposed him. Back in 10th grade, Kashuv had repeatedly used the N-word in a
  shared Google document created for a class assignment. When Harvard
  accepted him, his peers recovered the document and shared it with the
  media.</p>
  <p>There are reasons to applaud Harvard for refusing to take these
  students. Such decisions offer hope that future generations will be held
  accountable for racist, sexist, and homophobic behavior. This is a step in
  the right direction. But there is a flip side.</p>
  <p>When Kashuv discovered he had lost his place at Harvard, he did what any
  digital native would do-he shared his reaction online. On Twitter, he
  wrote, "Throughout its history, Harvard's faculty has included slave
  owners, segregationists, bigots and antisemites. If Harvard is suggesting
  that growth isn't possible and that our past defines our future, then
  Harvard is an inherently racist institution."</p>

  <p>2023: Duration: 37 parts, 14 hours</p>
  <p>The TROM documentary is trying to present, in a simplistic way, the
  world in which we, human beings, live. We try to present the world that was
  discovered so far through the lenses of science: from the evolution of
  everything (including us) to the monetary system (the game we currently
  play), to a different kind of world that we could build for the benefit of
  us all, then back to Earth.</p>
  <p>We are trying to present alternative solutions to current problems and
  take into account the future, which promises to be more than interesting.
  An informative documentary, perhaps shocking and disturbing to many,
  depending on how you digest the information. The documentary is divided
  into chapters and sub-chapters due to the documentary’s excessive length
  (14 hours) and all the parts are connected so we recommend that you see
  them in order.</p>

  <p>We live in a world where everyone is busy, everyone is consumed,
  everyone seems confused. Money, social credits, ads, data collection,
  prices and billionaires. Climate change? Who cares!</p>
  <p>A one-marble world, floating in a giant soup of stars and planets,
  clustered in donut-shaped galaxies.</p>
  <p>What are these humans living for?</p>
  <p>In a 5 hour, 4 parts documentary, we try to explore their world, to
  understand what makes them human, what makes them enslave their kind,
  destroy their habitat, and be unaware of their place in this universe. But
  also what makes them so special.</p>
  <p>Through the lives of 5 humans, we look at the culture that creates them,
  their struggles growing up on this planet, and where they are headed
  toward.</p>

  <p>The first light bulbs had a life of 2,500 hours, the consortium of
  manufacturers fined members who did went over the mandated 1,000 ours for
  household bulbs. Inventors have created bulb with lives of over 100,000
  hours. Inkjet printers stop working when they reach a limit on their
  cleaning cycle, because the absorbing sponge could not take any more. Buy a
  new printer is the only option. The first nylon stockings were very robust,
  but they had to be redesign to be more fragile. Designers are taught how to
  understand and meet the business goals of a product's "life cycle".</p>
  <p>Personally I see it all the time in software creation. Making and using
  robust software libraries and languages is not supported--the assertion is
  that defect free software is impossible. Well too expensive, for the
  expected life of the software product, is the real reason when engineer's
  press the issue. Defective software is good, because you can sell fixes, if
  new features can't be convincing enough.</p>
  <p>A bit at the end: getting off the "growth cycle". There can be jobs in
  repair and in closing the loop to eliminate waste.</p>

  <p>The idea of harvesting energy from graphene is controversial because it
  refutes physicist Richard Feynman's well-known assertion that the thermal
  motion of atoms, known as Brownian motion, cannot do work.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiLTEjm8zLw">Graphene

  <p>According to Kumar, the graphene and circuit share a symbiotic
  relationship. Though the thermal environment is performing work on the load
  resistor, the graphene and circuit are at the same temperature and heat
  does not flow between the two.</p>
  <p>"This means that the second law of thermodynamics is not violated, nor

  <p>Description: All across the internet, people are declaring modern life
  "empty" or "meaningless". This has been shouted from across the entire
  political spectrum, which makes me think there is some good philosophy to
  be had. So today we will look at Byung-Chul Han's <i>The Disappearance of
  Ritual,</i> where he charts the slow decline of rituals in our societies,
  and the disastrous impact this has on our feeling of meaning in our
  lives.</p>

  <p>Why do we all hate work so much? And why does it seem to have only got
  worse in the modern era? Well, according to philosopher Byung-Chul Han, our
  psychological attitude towards work and productivity has fundamentally
  shifted in a disastrous direction for our mental health, our happiness, and
  our long-term fulfilment.</p>

  <p>Longer life:</p>
  <p>To counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses against
  aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein, engage in intense
  exercise, experience uncomfortable cold [or hot]. When the body senses
  existential threats it triggers longevity genes, which attempt to maintain
  the body to ensure its survival until good times return.</p>
  <p>Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without the
  discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins to monitor
  and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging.</p>

    <p>Subsidiarity is a principle of social organization that holds that
    social and political issues should be dealt with at the most immediate or
    local level that is consistent with their resolution.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the United States of America, Article VI, Paragraph 2 of the
    constitution of the United States is known as the Supremacy Clause. This
    establishes that the federal constitution, and federal law generally,
    take precedence over state laws, and even state constitutions.[8] The
    principle of States' Rights is sometimes interpreted as being established
    by the Tenth Amendment, which says that "The powers not delegated to the
    United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,
    are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Potlatching was made illegal in Canada in 1884 in an amendment to the
    Indian Act. To some extent, this was at the urging of missionaries and
    government agents who considered it "a worse than useless custom" that
    was seen as wasteful, unproductive, and contrary to 'civilized values' of
    accumulation.<cite>{wikipedia-68}</cite></p>

  <p>MC is composed of many co-operative enterprises grouped into four areas:
  industry, finance, retail and knowledge. In each enterprise, the co-op
  members (averaging 80-85% of all workers per enterprise) collectively own
  and direct the enterprise. Through an annual general assembly the workers
  choose and employ a managing director and retain the power to make all the
  basic decisions of the enterprise (what, how and where to produce and what
  to do with the profits).</p>
  <p>As each enterprise is a constituent of the MC as a whole, its members
  must confer and decide with all other enterprise members what general rules
  will govern MC and all its constituent enterprises. In short, MC
  worker-members collectively choose, hire and fire the directors, whereas in
  capitalist enterprises the reverse occurs.</p>

  <p>WildX Speaker Filmmaker and Hypnotist Albert Nerenberg suggests there's
  something about sexuality the general public doesn't know. And it's
  potentially amazing. In this entertaining breakthrough talk Nerenberg
  explains he and Montreal hypnotist Dominique LaRoche stumbled on a largely
  unknown side of human trance behavior that opens up possibilities for
  sexual expression and healing. Humans can have orgasms without contact and
  with their clothes on. And they can do it by simply achieving a specific
  deeply relaxed state. Nerenberg claims this may open up possibilities for
  sexual healing but there is a need for an ethical framework. Either way,
  the implications are considerable and new.</p>

  <p>"We have an archaic idea of what family is," says Brooks in a new

  privilege of the wealthy. Across the world, 38 percent of people still live
  with extended family. And over the past half-century, the share of people
  living alone in America has doubled. The nuclear family is no longer the
  norm-and it should no longer be the ideal.</p>

  <p>This is a great series of podcasts. They do deep dives into trivial
  things. For example GPS time should be going slower than on Earth surface,
  because their relative speed is greater, but wait their relativity gravity
  effect is less so time is going faster than the surface of Earth. So the
  net result: GPS time is faster by about 38 microsecond/day. See Relativity

  <p>Problem: reinforced concrete only lasts 50 years. (100 years max)</p>
  <p>Solution: use an older process that emits less CO2, for making concrete,
  and don't use steel in concrete. Only build with compressive forces.</p>
  <p>My comment: This is a great analysis with solutions. However, to
  implement the solutions, the capitalist profit system will need to be
  overhauled to support 1,000-year developments. In the current system,
  cheaper and faster always wins over quality and longevity.</p>
